# General
## Git Basics
Перше знайомство з гіт-ом подарувало позитивні враження. Напочатку гіт сдається перевантаженним та заплутаним, однак чим більше з ним працюєш, тим легшим він здається (звісно, якщо опрацювати вивченний матеріал на практиці, чи це тільки поки що хах) та одразу розумієш переваги технології VCS і які переваги вона надає, особливо з командними проектами. Стандартний інтерфейс виглядає дещо незручним в представленні для новачка (можна викликати все дерево командною, але, все ж таки, не так зручно), було б чудово, якщо інтерфейс мав графічний вигляд як у [грі](learngitbranching.js.org) або щось на кшталт цього.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
The information about [Linux](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/) was totally new for me, but it was interesting to learning about it. Probably, i will use basic commands like "cd" or "ls", but many other commands don't look really useful if you use windows, but it's good to know about them.
Topic about HTTP protocols is important to web developers, I knew this information from the previous course, but I often forget many info, so it was nice to refresh my knowledge. All files added to the [folder](https://github.com/Ambeelight/kottans-frontend/tree/main/1.%20task_linux_cli).

## Git Collaboration
Really interesting and new information for me, many of those commands look interesting for projects, I think that I will try to use all of them to remember them and decide when is the best command to use it, like "cherry-pick" or "rebase -i". It looks hard to use git on real project, but I think it will be fixed by more practise. The [game](learngitbranching.js.org) is amazing and help me a lot to understand the git.

# Front-End Basics
## Intro to HTML & CSS
This course by [Yakov](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers) wasn't new for me because I completed it early, it contains good information and useful tips, but its lack that course is pretty old. The tasks on Codecademy is great, I'm wonder why I didn't use it before. It was great to refresh the knowledge about HTML and CSS. All files added to the [folder](https://github.com/Ambeelight/kottans-frontend/tree/main/3.%20task_html_css_intro).

## Responsive Web Design
Those games are amazing. All frogs on their own leafs and all the carrots are watered. It was new to learn more about "grid" and use it on practise, also I know new short commands like "grid-template" or "repeat" and "flex-flow" in flexbox. All those commands I want to use in the future. Grid or Flex? Who knows, both look useful. All files added to the [folder](https://github.com/Ambeelight/kottans-frontend/tree/main/4.%20task_responsive_web_design).

## HTML & CSS Practice
This task was difficult. I redid it twice, but for now it looks fine. I had many problems with size of icons and the button "More", I solved all my problems, but it took a long time. When I completed the task I made fatal mistake with git and deleted all my files, so i restart the course from the beginning, hah...

## JS Basics
I spent much time on that task for many reasons, but I learned a lot new things. Its pleasnat to see that JS evolves and becomes better with new versions. I need to practice more with arrays and objects, especially with array methods that contain many useful commands which make code shorter and save your time. Also, I had difficulties with algorithms, sometimes I spent a ton of time on simple tasks which sees obviuos and simple when you already know how to solve it hah. Anyway, I'm going to read more and practice the algorithms because I don't feel myself confident with them.

## DOM
It was a difficult but very useful task. All informanion about the Document Object Model was new to me so I googled a ton of intormation. I had issues with CSS and DOM, many of the issues were with logo images because they have different sizes and DOM properties. It was a pleasure to work with DOM, the site becomes "alive" and more interesting. I'm going to use all the knowledge gained and learn more about other DOM properties.

## A Tiny JS World
I thought it will be the easiest task, but... I had issues with Inheritance because I didn't know how to work with "super" and the first example of the task worked badly. I had some problems building the right tree, but now it seems good. As a result, It was a useful task and a good acquaintance with OOP in JS.
